# Handling Coding Issues in integrated Flask & Spring Docker Deployment

## Issue 1: Running `main.py` Directly vs. Using Gunicorn in Docker

### Problem
In a Dockerized Flask application, how do we ensure the application runs correctly using Gunicorn instead of directly running `main.py`?

### Solution
When deploying a Flask application with Docker, it is common practice to use a production-ready server like Gunicorn. Here’s a Dockerfile that achieves this:

```dockerfile
FROM python:3.10

WORKDIR /app

COPY . /app

RUN apt-get update && apt-get upgrade -y && \
    apt-get install -y git && \
    pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt && \
    pip install gunicorn

ENV GUNICORN_CMD_ARGS="--workers=1 --bind=0.0.0.0:8086"

EXPOSE 8086

CMD ["gunicorn", "main:app"]
```

In this setup, `main:app` refers to the `app` object in the `main.py` file. Gunicorn will handle serving the application, which is more suitable for production than Flask’s built-in development server.

## Issue 2: Running Code Blocks with Gunicorn

### Problem
When running the Flask application with Gunicorn, how do we ensure that certain initialization code (like `if __name__ == "__main__": app.run()`) does not run?

### Solution
When using Gunicorn, the `if __name__ == "__main__":` block is not executed. Instead, Gunicorn directly runs the application specified in the Dockerfile’s `CMD` instruction. Here is how you define the entry point in `main.py`:

```python
if __name__ == "__main__": 
    app.run(debug=True, host="0.0.0.0", port="8086")
```

However, this block will be ignored by Gunicorn, as Gunicorn will directly execute the `app` object. This ensures that the Flask development server is not started in a production environment.

## Issue 3: Conditional Data Initialization in the Database

### Problem
How do we initialize database tables only when they are empty to prevent duplicate data entries?

### Solution
Modify the `initXXX()` methods to check if the corresponding tables are empty before initializing them. Here is an example:

```python
from model.users import User
from model.players import Player
from model.titanicML import TitanicModel

def initUsers():
    if not User.query.all():
        # Initialize users
        pass

def initPlayers():
    if not Player.query.all():
        # Initialize players
        pass

def initTitanic():
    if not TitanicModel.query.all():
        # Initialize Titanic models
        pass
```

Then, use these methods in the custom CLI command to initialize data only when necessary:

```python
@custom_cli.command('generate_data')
def generate_data():
    initUsers()
    initPlayers()
    initTitanic()
```

This approach ensures that the database tables are populated only if they are empty, avoiding any duplicate entries.

By addressing these issues, we can ensure a robust and efficient deployment of our Flask application in a Docker environment, using best practices for production servers and proper database initialization techniques.
