    "# Wrapper Classes\n",
    "\n",
    "### What Are Wrapper Classes?\n",
    "Wrapper classes are classes that encapsualte (or wrap) primitive types. This allows for primitive data types to be used as objects. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Real Quick... What Are Primitive Types?\n",
    "Primitive data types are a set of basic data types from which all other data types are constructed. Primitive types are special data types built into the language; they are not objects created from a class.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Is This Useful?\n",
    "Wrapper classes must be used in order to store primitive types in Collections such as an ArrayList, which are only equipped to store objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What Are Some Examples Of Wrappers?\n",
    "Here's a table that shows primitive types and their equivalent wrapper class:\n",
    "\n",
    " Primitive Type | Wrapper Class |\n",
    "|--------|-----------|\n",
    "| byte | Byte | \n",
    "| short | Short |\n",
    "| int |  |\n",
    "| long | Long |\n",
    "| float | Float |\n",
    "| double |  |\n",
    "| boolean | Boolean |\n",
    "| char | Character |\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Popcorn Hack\n",
    "As you notice, the wrapper class for int and double has been left blank. Fill it in! You have 30 seconds.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How Do We Create A Wrapper Object?\n",
    "To create a wrapper object, you simply use the Wrapper class for the return type of your variable. For example...\n",
    "```java\n",
    "Integer grade = 11;\n",
    "Double GPA = 3.5;\n",
    "Character gradeLetter = 'A';\n",
    "```\n",
    "Look familiar? By using the wrapper class here, we are able to store these values into various collections that only take objects, such as an ArrayList.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "You can get information about a specific wrapper object by using these functions:\n",
    "```java\n",
    "intValue()\n",
    "byteValue() \n",
    "shortValue()\n",
    "longValue()\n",
    "floatValue()\n",
    "doubleValue()\n",
    "charValue()\n",
    "booleanValue()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also convert a wrapper object to a string using ```toString()```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hacks\n",
    "Now that you learned what wrapper classes are and ways to use them, it's time to implement them!\n",
    "\n",
    "a) Create a variable which is a double, and use what you've learned to turn that double into a string and print the length of the string.\n",
    "\n",
    "b) Provide an example of a wrapper object from your team project. If you don't have an example of a wrapper object ANYWHERE in your project, explain how you could implement them below:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "c) Finish the Popcorn Hack!"
