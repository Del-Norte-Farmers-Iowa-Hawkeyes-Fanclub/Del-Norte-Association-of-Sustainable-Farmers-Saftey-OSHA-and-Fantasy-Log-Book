    "First, a pivot is selected and compares itself against every other element in the array, and smaller elements move to the left of the pivot, and larger elements to the right. Spliting the list into 2 sub arrays: values less than the pivot, and values greater than the pivot. Then the quick sort function is recursively called and a new pivot is selected. This continues on and on, for each subarray, until the array is fully sorted. "

    "As we iterate through our input positions, we will have O(n) time complexity. Then, when we split the array into 2 smaller component arrays weâ€™ll have an O(log (n)) complexity, creating a total time complexity of O(n log(n)). Then,  we make a recursive call on each of our component arrays, looking at each element and then continuing to split it into its own component arrays, thus creating another O(n log(n)) call. "
