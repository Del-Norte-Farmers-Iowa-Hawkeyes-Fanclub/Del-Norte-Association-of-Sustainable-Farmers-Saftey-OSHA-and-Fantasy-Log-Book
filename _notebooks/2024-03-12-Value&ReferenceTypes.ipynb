    "- In Java, there are two main types of data types primitive/value types and reference types.  \n",

    "\n",
    "## General Information\n",
    "- Reference types are a subclass of the java.lang.Object class.\n",
    "- Reference types can be defined by the user\n",
    "- When two references are assigned to each other the will both point to the same object in memory.\n",
    "- When objects are passed into an object the method changes the content of the object but not the location of the object in memory.\n",
    "- A reference type is a reference to the actual data, that is they allow for us to be able to access objects stored elsewhere in memory. What typically occurs when we create a reference type the object is stored onto the stack and the value that corresponds to the object is stored in the heap. For instance if we create a Cat class: "
